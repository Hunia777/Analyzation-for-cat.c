## THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO WORKS THE "cat" In LINUX
	Therefore, copyrights for this code is in GNU
	I try to revise something from this original cat.c

### Make a new option
	I make a new option "-h"
	It shows where you are in your terminal(Directory information)
	I make it just using fork() and execl() to use "pwd"

### Write some annotation for me
	Therefore, a little annotation was written by Korean.
